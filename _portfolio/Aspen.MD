As an assignment for Phase Equilibria and Rate Based Separations I was tasked with designing a multicomponent separation column. The column needed to separate hydrocarbons of similar molecular weight and structure with a 98.54% recovery of propane in the distilate. I developed a multistep process that achieved this separation, defining the number of stages, optimal feed stage, required reflux ratio, and heat duty.

To achieve this, I used Peng-Robinson Equations of State to model the physical properties of the system. Then I estimated the Underwood equation to estimate the minimum required reflux ratio. Finally I varied different the stage number and feed stage sequentially until the process met the design specifications.
